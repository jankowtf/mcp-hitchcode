# Game Plan: Docker Prompt Template Optimization

## Overview
This game plan outlines the process for optimizing the Docker prompt template. The goal is to create a more concise template that embeds Docker configurations from external files rather than hard-coding them, while maintaining the same meta-section structure used in other prompt templates.

## Objective
Create an optimized Docker prompt template that embeds Docker configs instead of having hard-coded instructions, making it more maintainable, concise, and focused on instructing coding agents.

## Requirements
1. Remove hard-coded Docker instructions (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml) from the prompt template
2. Embed content from existing Docker-related templates using proper syntax
3. Maintain consistency with meta-sections marked with `< ... >` as in other templates
4. Focus on instructions for coding agents on how to set up Docker infrastructure
5. Reduce verbosity while maintaining comprehensive guidance

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Stage 1: Template Analysis
Tasks:
- [x] Analyze the existing Docker prompt template structure (v1.0.0 and v1.1.0)
- [x] Examine the meta-sections used in both Docker templates and other prompt templates
- [x] Identify the embedding mechanism used for Docker configurations
- [x] Determine which sections are verbose and can be optimized
- [x] Map out dependencies on other template files

### ✅ Stage 2: Template Design
Tasks:
- [x] Create the new template file (docker_v1.2.0.md) with proper version metadata
- [x] Implement the meta-sections following the standard format
- [x] Setup template embedding for Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- [x] Rewrite instructions to focus on guiding coding agents rather than providing Docker details
- [x] Remove redundant or overly verbose sections while maintaining necessary guidance
- [x] Ensure all required meta-sections match the format of other prompt templates

### ✅ Stage 3: Template Validation
Tasks:
- [x] Verify the template correctly embeds Docker configurations
- [x] Check that all meta-sections follow the required format
- [x] Ensure instructions focus on guiding coding agents for Docker setup
- [x] Validate that the template is more concise than previous versions
- [x] Test that no essential instruction information was lost in optimization

## Success Criteria
1. The template successfully embeds Docker configurations instead of hard-coding them
2. All meta-sections are properly formatted and consistent with other templates
3. The template is noticeably more concise than previous versions
4. Instructions are clear and focused on guiding coding agents
5. No essential Docker guidance is lost despite the reduction in verbosity

## Technical Decisions

### Embedding Mechanism
The template will use Jinja2-style syntax (`{{ docker_file('path') }}` and `{{ docker_compose('path') }}`) to embed Docker configuration files, consistent with the existing mechanism in v1.1.0.

### Template Structure
The template will maintain the same meta-section structure as other prompt templates, ensuring consistency across the system.

### Version Control
The template will include proper version metadata (v1.2.0) and a changelog that describes the changes made from previous versions.

## Impact Analysis
- **Maintainability**: Embedding Docker configurations will make the template more maintainable as Docker best practices evolve
- **Consistency**: Following the same meta-section structure ensures consistency with other templates
- **Usability**: A more concise template focused on agent instructions will be easier to understand and use
- **Extensibility**: The template will be easier to extend with new Docker configurations in the future

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Essential Docker guidance might be lost in optimization
  - **Mitigation**: Carefully review each section to ensure critical information is preserved
- **Risk**: Template might not properly embed Docker configurations
  - **Mitigation**: Test the template with actual Docker files to ensure embedding works correctly

## Documentation Requirements
- Include clear version metadata and changelog
- Document the embedding mechanism and required Docker files
- Explain the purpose and structure of each meta-section
