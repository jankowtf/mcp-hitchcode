# Game Plan: Docker Prompt Template

## Overview
This game plan outlines the steps to create a Docker prompt template that follows the established structure and formatting of existing templates in the repository. The template will provide comprehensive instructions for Docker containerization tasks.

## Objective
Create a Docker prompt template for containerization that maintains consistency with other prompt templates while providing specialized Docker-specific guidance.

## Stages

### âœ… Stage 1: Directory Structure Setup
Tasks:
- [x] Create a dedicated `docker` folder inside `mcp_hitchcode/templates/prompts/`
- [x] Confirm directory structure matches other template directories

### Stage 2: Template File Creation
Tasks:
- [ ] Create the initial versioned Docker template file (`docker_v1.0.0.md`)
- [ ] Set up proper frontmatter with version, creation date, and description
- [ ] Define template variables consistent with other templates
- [ ] Add initial changelog entry

### Stage 3: Template Structure Standardization
Tasks:
- [ ] Implement standard sections (authority-framework, workflow-protocol, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure recursion-protection is properly configured
- [ ] Standardize section naming to match other templates
- [ ] Implement consistent formatting for directives and warnings
- [ ] Ensure objective-definition and specific-instructions sections are properly templated

### Stage 4: Docker-Specific Content Optimization
Tasks:
- [ ] Refine Docker patterns and examples to ensure they're up-to-date
- [ ] Update implementation principles for Docker best practices
- [ ] Ensure Docker Compose configuration examples are comprehensive
- [ ] Validate security recommendations align with current best practices
- [ ] Confirm artifact management section follows the same pattern as other templates
- [ ] Standardize compliance framework checkpoints

### Stage 5: Testing and Integration
Tasks:
- [ ] Verify the template can be correctly loaded by the MCP server
- [ ] Ensure proper variable substitution works as expected
- [ ] Confirm the template version handling functions correctly
- [ ] Test template rendering with sample inputs

## Implementation Details

### Template Structure
The Docker template will follow the same structure as other templates:
- Frontmatter with version, date, description, variables, and changelog
- Authority framework to establish the directive's priority
- Workflow protocol defining the required steps
- Recursion protection to prevent duplication
- Template variables for objective and specific instructions
- Docker-specific sections for patterns, best practices, and implementation guidance
- Confirmation framework with mandatory checkpoints
- Transition mechanism for workflow stages

### Version Management
We will use semantic versioning (SemVer) starting with version 1.0.0. Future updates will increment according to:
- Patch (1.0.x) for minor corrections or clarifications
- Minor (1.x.0) for new features that maintain backward compatibility
- Major (x.0.0) for significant restructuring or breaking changes

## Reasoning
The existing draft template already contains most of the required sections and Docker-specific guidance. Our approach will be to preserve the valuable Docker content while reformatting and restructuring to match the established template pattern. This approach allows us to leverage the existing Docker expertise in the draft while ensuring consistency with the template ecosystem.

## Impact Analysis
- **User Experience**: Providing a consistent template structure makes it easier for users to navigate between different template types
- **Maintainability**: Following the established pattern simplifies future updates across all templates
- **Integration**: Conforming to existing server functions ensures the template works seamlessly with the MCP platform

## Success Criteria
- Template exists in the correct location with proper versioning
- All sections are properly formatted according to the established template pattern
- Docker-specific content is preserved and properly integrated
- Template can be successfully loaded and rendered by the MCP server
- Variable substitution works correctly
