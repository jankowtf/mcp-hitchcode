# Game Plan: Python Snake Game

## Overview
This game plan outlines the implementation of a straightforward Snake game in Python. The game will feature the classic snake mechanics with additional elements: fruits that increase the snake's length and bombs that decrease it. Each time a fruit is eaten, a new bomb will appear on the canvas. Bombs remain until hit by the snake.

## Architecture
The game will be built using the following architecture:

1. **Game Engine**: Pygame for rendering, input handling, and collision detection
2. **Game Objects**:
   - `Snake`: Manages the snake's segments, movement, and growth/shrinkage
   - `Fruit`: Represents collectible items that increase snake length
   - `Bomb`: Represents obstacles that decrease snake length
   - `GameBoard`: Manages the game area and placement of objects
3. **Main Components**:
   - `main.py`: Entry point with game initialization and main loop
   - `game.py`: Core game logic and state management
   - `objects/`: Directory containing game object classes
   - `utils.py`: Helper functions for calculations and utilities

## Implementation Stages

### ✅ Stage 1: Project Setup
Tasks:
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Set up poetry for dependency management
- [x] Add pygame as a dependency
- [x] Create README.md with game description and instructions
- [x] Set up basic entry point (main.py)

Acceptance Criteria:
- Project structure is established
- Dependencies are properly configured
- Basic documentation is in place

Implementation Notes:
- Created the project structure with main package and subpackages
- Initialized poetry and added pygame as a dependency
- Created comprehensive README.md with game description, features, and instructions
- Set up a basic entry point (main.py) with minimal initialization code

### ✅ Stage 2: Core Game Logic
Tasks:
- [x] Implement Snake class with basic movement
- [x] Implement GameBoard class for managing the game area
- [x] Create collision detection system
- [x] Implement basic game loop with state management
- [x] Add keyboard controls for snake movement

Acceptance Criteria:
- Snake can move in four directions
- Snake movement is controlled by keyboard
- Basic collision detection works
- Game loop runs smoothly

Implementation Notes:
- Created utils.py with common constants and helper functions
- Implemented Snake class with movement, growth, and collision detection
- Implemented GameBoard class for managing the game area and object placement
- Created Game class with game loop and state management
- Added keyboard controls for snake movement and game control
- Implemented collision detection for walls and self

### Stage 3: Game Rendering
Tasks:
- [ ] Set up Pygame display and rendering
- [ ] Implement rendering for the game board
- [ ] Create visual representation of the snake
- [ ] Add simple UI elements (score, game status)
- [ ] Implement game boundaries

Acceptance Criteria:
- Game elements are properly rendered
- UI displays relevant game information
- Game boundaries are enforced
- Visual feedback is clear and intuitive

### Stage 4: Game Mechanics
Tasks:
- [ ] Implement Fruit class with random placement
- [ ] Add snake growth when eating fruits
- [ ] Implement Bomb class with placement logic
- [ ] Add snake shrinking when hitting bombs
- [ ] Implement the mechanic to add a new bomb when a fruit is eaten
- [ ] Ensure bombs remain until hit

Acceptance Criteria:
- Fruits appear randomly on the board
- Snake grows when eating fruits
- Bombs appear when fruits are eaten
- Snake shrinks when hitting bombs
- Game mechanics match the requirements

### Stage 5: Finalization
Tasks:
- [ ] Add scoring system
- [ ] Implement game over conditions
- [ ] Add game restart functionality
- [ ] Polish visuals and add simple effects
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Add final documentation

Acceptance Criteria:
- Game has clear win/lose conditions

- Game can be restarted
- Performance is smooth
- Documentation is complete

### Key Components

#### Snake
- Represented as a list of coordinates (segments)
- Has direction and speed properties
- Methods for movement, growth, and shrinkage
- Collision detection with itself, fruits, bombs, and walls

#### Fruit
- Single coordinate position
- Random placement logic
- Visual representation

#### Bomb
- Single coordinate position
- Placement logic triggered by fruit consumption
- Visual representation
- Remains on board until hit

#### GameBoard
- Grid-based representation of the game area
- Methods for placing objects
- Collision detection helpers

#### Game Loop
1. Process input
2. Update game state
3. Render game
4. Check for game over conditions
5. Repeat

## Reasoning
The architecture is designed to be modular and straightforward, making it easy to implement and extend. The separation of concerns between game objects and the main game logic allows for clean code organization and easier testing.

Using Pygame provides a simple yet powerful framework for handling graphics, input, and timing without adding unnecessary complexity.

The staged approach to implementation ensures that we build a solid foundation before adding more complex features, reducing the risk of bugs and making debugging easier.

## Impact Analysis
- **Performance**: The game should run smoothly on most systems as Snake is not computationally intensive.
- **Maintainability**: The modular design makes it easy to modify or extend the game.
- **User Experience**: Simple controls and clear visual feedback will make the game intuitive to play.

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful when:
1. The snake can move in all four directions
2. Fruits increase the snake's length when eaten
3. Bombs decrease the snake's length when hit
4. A new bomb appears each time a fruit is eaten
5. Bombs remain on the canvas until hit
6. The game has clear win/lose conditions
7. The game runs smoothly without bugs or performance issues
