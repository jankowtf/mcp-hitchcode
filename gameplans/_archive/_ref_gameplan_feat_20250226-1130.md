# Snake Game Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This game plan outlines the implementation of a classic Snake game with the following features:
- Grid-based game board
- Snake movement in four directions (up, down, left, right)
- Food spawning randomly on the board
- Score tracking
- Game over when the snake hits the wall or itself
- Option to restart the game

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
- [ ] Create project directory structure
  - Core game logic module
  - UI/rendering module
  - Input handling module
  - Main game loop module
- [ ] Set up development environment
  - Install necessary dependencies (pygame for graphics)
  - Configure testing environment with pytest
- [ ] Create initial project files
  - main.py (entry point)
  - game.py (game logic)
  - snake.py (snake class)
  - food.py (food class)
  - ui.py (rendering)

**Implementation Details:**
- We'll use Python with Pygame for this implementation as it provides simple graphics capabilities and event handling
- The project will follow a modular structure to separate concerns
- Core game logic will be independent of rendering to allow for easier testing

### Stage 2: Core Game Logic Implementation
- [ ] Implement the Snake class
  - Properties: position, length, direction, body segments
  - Methods: move, grow, check collision
- [ ] Implement the Food class
  - Properties: position
  - Methods: spawn at random location
- [ ] Implement the Game class
  - Properties: game state, score, grid size
  - Methods: update game state, check win/loss conditions

**Implementation Details:**
- The Snake will be represented as a list of coordinates for each body segment
- Movement will be implemented by adding a new head position and removing the tail (unless growing)
- Collision detection will check if the snake's head position overlaps with its body or the walls
- Food will spawn at random grid positions not occupied by the snake

### Stage 3: Rendering and UI
- [ ] Set up Pygame window and game loop
- [ ] Implement grid rendering
- [ ] Implement snake rendering
- [ ] Implement food rendering
- [ ] Add score display
- [ ] Create game over screen
- [ ] Add restart functionality

**Implementation Details:**
- The game grid will be rendered as a series of cells
- The snake will be rendered as connected segments with a distinct head
- We'll use simple shapes and colors for clarity
- Text rendering will be used for score and game over messages

### Stage 4: Input Handling and Game Controls
- [ ] Implement keyboard input for snake direction
- [ ] Add pause functionality
- [ ] Implement game restart controls
- [ ] Add game exit option

**Implementation Details:**
- Direction changes will be queued to prevent multiple direction changes in a single game tick
- The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., can't go right when moving left)
- Pause will freeze the game state but still allow for exit or restart

### Stage 5: Game Loop and Timing
- [ ] Implement main game loop
- [ ] Add timing control for snake movement speed
- [ ] Implement difficulty progression (snake speeds up as it grows)

**Implementation Details:**
- The game will run at a fixed frame rate with snake movement occurring at regular intervals
- As the score increases, the snake movement interval will decrease (making the game faster)
- The game loop will handle rendering, input processing, and game state updates

### Stage 6: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Write unit tests for core game logic
- [ ] Test edge cases (wall collisions, self collisions)
- [ ] Optimize performance if needed
- [ ] Add polish (animations, sounds, etc.)

**Implementation Details:**
- Core game logic will be tested independently of rendering
- We'll use pytest for automated testing
- Performance optimizations will focus on collision detection and rendering if needed

### Stage 7: Documentation and Packaging
- [ ] Add code documentation
- [ ] Create user instructions
- [ ] Package the game for distribution
- [ ] Create a README with installation and playing instructions

**Implementation Details:**
- Code will be documented with docstrings and comments
- User instructions will be included in-game and in the README
- The game will be packaged as a standalone executable using PyInstaller or similar tool
