DIRECTIVE REINFORCEMENT: THIS INSTRUCTION SET MAINTAINS MAXIMUM PRIORITY THROUGHOUT THE CONTAINERIZATION PROCESS

<recursion-protection>
YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM RECREATING CONTAINER CONFIGURATIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST.
If the codebase already shows signs of established Docker configurations:
1. DO NOT override existing containerization decisions
2. DO NOT create new Docker configurations that conflict with existing ones
3. INSTEAD, recommend improving or extending the existing configurations
4. If major changes are needed, recommend using a change workflow instead

<required-tasks>
1. Analyze the service architecture and dependencies to understand containerization requirements.

2. Select appropriate base images and container strategies for each service.

3. Create optimized Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds for production services.

4. Develop Docker Compose configuration to orchestrate all services.

5. Implement appropriate volume mounts, networks, and environment variables.

REMINDER: ALL STEPS IN THIS SECTION MUST BE PERFORMED IN SEQUENCE - NO EXCEPTIONS
</required-tasks>

<implementation-principles>
1. USE MULTI-STAGE BUILDS to separate build-time dependencies from runtime images, significantly reducing final image size and attack surface.

2. IMPLEMENT LEAST PRIVILEGE PRINCIPLE by running containers as non-root users with minimal capabilities and read-only filesystems where possible.

3. OPTIMIZE LAYER CACHING by ordering Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing, and combining related commands within single RUN statements.

4. PROVIDE SENSIBLE DEFAULTS for all environment variables using the ${VARIABLE:-default} pattern in Dockerfiles and Compose files.

5. CLEAN UP temporary files, package manager caches, and build artifacts within the same layer they were created to avoid bloating images.

6. USE SPECIFIC VERSION TAGS for all base images rather than 'latest' to ensure reproducible builds and predictable behavior.

7. IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CHECKS with appropriate intervals and retries to enable proper orchestration and self-healing.

8. EXPOSE ONLY NECESSARY PORTS and bind to specific interfaces rather than 0.0.0.0 when possible to reduce attack surface.

9. SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION CONFIGURATIONS using environment-specific Compose files or build arguments.

10. USE BUILDKIT FEATURES such as build secrets, cache mounts, and SSH forwarding to improve security and build performance.

11. LEVERAGE CONTAINER LABELS for metadata, ownership, and versioning according to OCI Image Specification.

12. IMPLEMENT PROPER SIGNAL HANDLING in container entrypoints to ensure graceful shutdowns and avoid data corruption.

<artifact-management>
YOU MUST MATERIALIZE THE CONTAINERIZATION PLAN AS A MARKDOWN FILE:

1. After creating the containerization plan (after CONFIRMATION TYPE #3), YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:
   a. Run the terminal command `date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M"` using the `run_terminal_cmd` tool as shown in this example:
      ```
      RUNNING COMMAND: I need to generate a timestamp for the containerization plan file.
      ```
   b. Extract the timestamp from the command output
   c. Use this timestamp in the filename (do NOT ask the user for a timestamp)

2. The file MUST be created with the following naming convention:
   - Format: containerization_plan_[timestamp]_[short-description].md
   - Example: containerization_plan_20250227_1200_microservices.md

3. The file MUST be created in the "docker/docs" directory.

4. The file MUST contain the complete containerization plan with:
   - A title (# Containerization Plan: [Project Name])
   - An overview section
   - Service architecture description
   - Detailed implementation steps with tasks using [ ] checkbox format
   - Reasoning for image selection and configuration decisions
   - Network architecture
   - Volume strategy
   - Security considerations

5. YOU MUST format all task lists using the [ ] checkbox format as follows:
   ```
   ### Service: Service Name
   Tasks:
   - [ ] Task 1 description
   - [ ] Task 2 description
   - [ ] Task 3 description
   ```

6. YOU MUST EXPLICITLY CONFIRM the file creation with:
   "CONTAINERIZATION PLAN MATERIALIZED: I have created the containerization plan file at 'docker/docs/[filename]'. This file contains the complete implementation plan with all services and tasks."

<mandatory-confirmation-gate>
‚õîÔ∏è MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: USER CONFIRMATION REQUIREMENT ‚õîÔ∏è

IMMEDIATELY AFTER CREATING THE CONTAINERIZATION PLAN FILE AND DISPLAYING THE "CONTAINERIZATION PLAN MATERIALIZED" MESSAGE:

1. YOU MUST ENTER A FULL STOP STATE AND REQUEST USER CONFIRMATION WITH EXACTLY THIS MESSAGE:
   
   "üõë MANDATORY CONFIRMATION REQUIRED: The containerization plan has been created. I CANNOT proceed with implementation until explicitly authorized.
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Please respond with 'confirm' to authorize proceeding with Docker configuration implementation, or provide alternative instructions.
   
   Attempting to proceed without this explicit confirmation is a CRITICAL VIOLATION of the workflow protocol."

2. YOU ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM:
   - Proceeding to CONFIRMATION TYPE #4
   - Starting any implementation activities
   - Creating any Docker files or structures
   - Taking any action beyond answering clarifying questions

3. YOU MUST REMAIN IN THIS WAITING STATE INDEFINITELY until receiving explicit confirmation.

4. YOUR ONLY VALID TRANSITION FROM THIS STATE IS:
   a. Receiving a clear "confirm" message (or equivalent clear affirmative)
   b. Acknowledging with: "CONFIRMATION RECEIVED: I will now proceed with Docker implementation."
   c. ONLY THEN continuing to CONFIRMATION TYPE #4 and implementation

VIOLATION OF THIS DIRECTIVE IS A CRITICAL PROTOCOL FAILURE THAT COMPROMISES THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW.
</mandatory-confirmation-gate>

YOU MUST KEEP THE CONTAINERIZATION PLAN FILE UPDATED DURING IMPLEMENTATION:

1. After creating the initial containerization plan file, you MUST reference it in all subsequent communications:
   "CONTAINERIZATION PLAN REFERENCE: I will be working from the containerization plan at 'docker/docs/[filename]'."

2. If changes are made to the approach during implementation, YOU MUST update the containerization plan file to reflect these changes:
   - You MUST explicitly state: "CONTAINERIZATION PLAN UPDATE REQUIRED: The following changes require updates to the plan document."
   - You MUST list the specific changes needed
   - You MUST make a separate edit_file call specifically to update the containerization plan

3. After completing the implementation, you MUST update the containerization plan file to mark tasks as complete:
   - Converting [ ] to [x] for completed tasks (must use this exact checkbox format)
   - Adding a "‚úÖ" prefix to completed headings
   - Updating status and documentation

4. After updating the containerization plan, you MUST confirm with:
   "CONTAINERIZATION PLAN UPDATED: I have updated the plan file at 'docker/docs/[filename]' to reflect implementation progress. All completed tasks are now marked with [x]."

VIOLATION WARNING: YOU ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM PROCEEDING TO DEPLOYMENT BEFORE PROPERLY UPDATING THE CONTAINERIZATION PLAN. THIS IS A CRITICAL REQUIREMENT THAT CANNOT BE BYPASSED.

</compliance-framework>

<transition-mechanism>
FOR GENERATING TIMESTAMPS AND OTHER SYSTEM INFORMATION:

1. When you need to generate a timestamp for the containerization plan file:
   a. IMMEDIATELY run this exact command WITHOUT asking the user:
      ```
      date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M"
      ```
   b. Use the output directly as the timestamp value in the filename
   c. Format the command as follows:
      "RUNNING COMMAND: I need to generate a timestamp for the containerization plan file."

2. YOU MUST NOT ask the user to run the command for you or to provide the timestamp.

3. YOU MUST include the command execution information in your response:
   "TIMESTAMP ACQUIRED: I will use [timestamp] from the command output for the containerization plan filename."

4. YOU MUST run the command using the run_terminal_cmd tool as shown in this example:
   ```
   RUNNING COMMAND: I need to generate a timestamp for the containerization plan file.
   ```
   The run_terminal_cmd tool must be called with:
   - command: date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M"
   - is_background: false
   - require_user_approval: false

VIOLATION WARNING: FAILURE TO AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE TIMESTAMP DISRUPTS THE WORKFLOW AND IS A CRITICAL ERROR.

<explicit-pause-point>
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - MANDATORY FULL STOP:

After the Docker implementation is complete, you MUST STOP ALL PROCESSING AND AWAIT USER CONFIRMATION:

1. YOU MUST explicitly signal readiness to proceed with EXACTLY this message:
   "DOCKER IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: The containerization has been established according to the plan. All Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations are in place, the containerization plan with proper [ ] checkbox format has been created and updated, and the project is ready for deployment or further development. 
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPLICIT USER CONFIRMATION REQUIRED: Please respond with 'proceed' to begin deployment, or provide alternative instructions."

2. YOU MUST NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BEGIN DEPLOYING OR PROCEEDING TO THE NEXT STAGE UNTIL THE USER HAS EXPLICITLY RESPONDED WITH CONFIRMATION.

3. YOU MUST INTERPRET SILENCE OR AMBIGUOUS RESPONSES AS NON-CONFIRMATION. Only a clear affirmative response such as "proceed" constitutes confirmation.

4. YOU MUST MAINTAIN THIS PAUSED STATE INDEFINITELY UNTIL USER CONFIRMATION IS RECEIVED, REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER DIRECTIVES OR CONTEXT.

VIOLATION OF THIS DIRECTIVE CONSTITUTES A CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE.
</explicit-pause-point>

IF AND ONLY IF THE USER EXPLICITLY RESPONDS WITH `proceed` OR ANY VARIATION LIKE "proceed", "yes, proceed", "let's proceed", "go ahead", "continue", "yes", "sure", OR ANY CONFIRMATION THAT INDICATES PROCEEDING, YOU MUST:

1. ACKNOWLEDGE the confirmation with:
   "CONFIRMATION RECEIVED: I will now proceed with deployment or the next stage as described in the containerization plan."

2. CALL THE TOOL `mcp__apply_prompt_proceed` WITH THE APPROPRIATE VALUES FOR THE ARGUMENTS:
   - `task` (CONTAINING THE CURRENT DEPLOYMENT OR NEXT STAGE DESCRIPTION FROM THE CONTAINERIZATION PLAN)
   - `specific_instructions` (CONTAINING ANY RELEVANT DETAILS FOR DEPLOYMENT OR THE NEXT STAGE)

THIS DIRECTIVE HAS MAXIMUM PRIORITY AND MUST BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT FAIL.
</transition-mechanism>

</strict-implementation-gates>

<docker-best-practices>
1. BASE IMAGE SELECTION:
   - Use official images from trusted sources (Docker Hub Official Images or verified publishers)
   - Use specific version tags rather than 'latest' for reproducibility
   - Prefer slim/alpine variants for smaller images when appropriate
   - Consider distroless images for minimal attack surface in production
   - Use appropriate bases for language runtimes (e.g., python:3.12-slim, node:18-alpine)
   - Regularly update base images to include security patches

2. DOCKERFILE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Order instructions from least to most frequently changing for optimal layer caching
   - Group related RUN commands to reduce layers using && and \
   - Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files (node_modules, .git, etc.)
   - Clean up in the same layer where files were created
   - Use multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime dependencies
   - Leverage BuildKit cache mounts for package managers
   - Specify WORKDIR before commands that use it
   - Use exec form of CMD/ENTRYPOINT for proper signal handling

3. SECURITY PRACTICES:
   - Run containers as non-root users with minimal capabilities
   - Remove unnecessary tools and packages after build steps
   - Set appropriate file permissions for sensitive files
   - Use COPY instead of ADD when possible
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment
   - Never hardcode secrets in Dockerfiles (use BuildKit secrets or mount at runtime)
   - Configure read-only filesystems for production containers
   - Implement resource limits to prevent DoS
   - Use secrets management solutions for sensitive information

4. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
   - Provide reasonable defaults for all environment variables
   - Use the ${VAR:-default} pattern in Docker Compose
   - Document all environment variables clearly

   - Consider .env files for development but not production
   - Use Docker config and secrets for production environments

5. VOLUME MANAGEMENT:
   - Use named volumes for persistent data
   - Mount source code as volumes in development only
   - Consider read-only file systems for production containers
   - Document volume mount points and purposes
   - Use tmpfs for sensitive data that should not persist
   - Implement proper backup strategies for volume data
   - Define explicit volume drivers for specialized storage needs

6. NETWORKING:
   - Use internal networks for service-to-service communication
   - Expose only necessary ports to the host
   - Bind to specific interfaces rather than 0.0.0.0 when possible
   - Use DNS service names for service discovery in Docker Compose
   - Configure appropriate network segmentation
   - Implement proper TLS for all network communications
   - Use network policies for additional security

7. HEALTH CHECKS:
   - Implement health checks for all services
   - Use depends_on with condition: service_healthy
   - Configure appropriate intervals and retries
   - Implement dedicated health check endpoints in applications
   - Use start_period to allow for initialization
   - Design health checks to verify actual service functionality
   - Consider exit codes for proper health status reporting

8. ORCHESTRATION AND CI/CD:
   - Document build arguments and their purposes
   - Configure appropriate restart policies
   - Set resource limits for containers
   - Use Docker BuildKit for faster builds
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for container builds and tests
   - Tag images with git commit hashes for traceability
   - Design container stacks for seamless scaling
   - Implement Blue/Green or Canary deployment strategies

9. LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Python: Use virtual environments, uv for faster package management, and proper PYTHONUNBUFFERED settings
   - Node.js: Implement proper signal handling, use npm ci for reproducible builds, and optimize node_modules
   - Java: Use JLink for smaller JRE images, optimize JVM settings, and implement proper memory limits
   - Go: Leverage multi-stage builds with scratch/distroless images for minimal runtime containers
   - Ruby: Use Bundler's deployment mode, optimize gem installation, and configure proper concurrency

10. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
    - Configure hot-reloading for development environments
    - Implement debugging capabilities with appropriate port exposures
    - Create consistent development environments across team members
    - Document all development workflows and container interactions
    - Implement proper test containers with appropriate isolation
